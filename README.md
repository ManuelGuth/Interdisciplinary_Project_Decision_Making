# Interdisciplinary Project Decision Making
Interdisciplinary Project at the Cognitive Computation Lab as part of my  CS master.

The goal of this project is to create a task for the CCOBRA-Framework for cognitive reasoning and provide it with some baselines for easy benchmarking of implemented models.
Furthermore, to investigate the power of deep learning in human decision making two deep learning models are implemented.
